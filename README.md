# Simplex Universe Concept Project
A working concept demo for my Simplex Universe project written in C#. The following code is origional code for Simplex Universe as it was around December of 2014. This is before the mathematics and physics libraries became seperate projects. Note that many features do not yet work and the code for this version of the project can be rather ugly in some places. Note also that the beautiful UI of this program is largly thanks to the [Metro Modern UI](https://github.com/viperneo/winforms-modernui "viperneo/winforms-modernui GitHub Page") project.

## COMPILING
This project depends on the [Metro Modern UI](https://github.com/viperneo/winforms-modernui "viperneo/winforms-modernui GitHub Page") NuGet packages, which may need to be added to the project before compiling. Other than that, you shouldn't have any problems compiling the source code (within Visual Studio). If you don't want to compile your own executable, you can find one that I compiled myself in the "Simplex Universe Concept Project - Compiled x86_64.zip" file.

## HOW TO RUN
To run start one of the built-in visualizations, exit out of the welcome form and from the main menu strip select one of the options under the "Debug" menu. This will load one of the simulations. You can then select "Simulation > Start" from the main menu to start the simulation. Clicking and dragging the mouse will move the camera around the center of the simulation (you can also use the arrow keys). The mouse wheel (or + and - keys) will zoom the simulation in and out. You can still rotate and zoom the simulation while it is paused. There are plenty of other hidden features as well.

## WORKING FEATURES
* C# Scripting
* 2D/3D Visualization
